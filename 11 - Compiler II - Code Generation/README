README - This file.

JackCompiler.py - main file of the program. for each jack file it utilizes JackTokenizer.py to create a tokenizer from the jack file and VMWriter to create a VM code writer.
Then it creates a a CompilationEngine from the tokenizer and the VMWriter, and runs the CompilationEngine.

JackTokenizer.py - reads in a jack file and parses it to tokens

VMWriter.py - opens a vm file and writes lines of code to it.

CompilationEngine.py - recursively compiles a jack class by reading in tokens from a tokenizer and using the methods of the VMwriter to write the code to a vm file.

Makefile, JackAnalyzer - to ensure executability of program
