README - This file.

Memory.hdl - controls the reading of and writing to all of our computer's memory,
including RAM, the screen memory map, and the keyboard memory map.

CPU.hdl - the central processing unit of our computer, consisting of an ALU, 
two registers, and a program counter. at each tick tock the CPU gets an instruction
and outputs the value resulting from the current instruction and the address of the
next instruction. the CPU's execution of the program can be reset.

Computer.hdl - the full Hack computer, consisting of RAM, ROM, and a CPU.
begins execution of the program stored in the ROM when reset bit is set to 1

ExtendAlu.hdl - an extension of the previously implemented ALU chip to add
the multiplication and shift operations. implemented using an ALU chip and additional
chips to calculate the new operations and using logic gates to output the correct output.

CpuMul.hdl - an adaptation of the CPU to support multiplication and shift
operations, implemented identically to the CPU except for the substitution
of the ALU chip with the new ExtendAlu chip.
