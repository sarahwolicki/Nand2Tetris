README - This file.
Not.hdl - single-input Not gate, converts input from 1 to 0 and vice versa
And.hdl - And gate, gets two inputs. outputs 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise 0
Or.hdl - Or gate, gets two inputs. outputs 1 if one or both inputs are 1, otherwise 0
Xor.hdl - Exclusive Or gate, gets two inputs. outputs 1 iff one input is 1, otherwise 0
Mux.hdl - Multiplexor gate, gets three inputs (a, b, sel). outputs a if sel=0 and b if sel=1
DMux.hdl - Demultiplexor gate, gets two inputs (in, sel). outputs {in, 0} if sel=0, and {0, in} if sel=1
Not16.hdl - 16-bit Not gate, applies Not gate to all bits of input bus
And16.hdl - 16-bit And gate, gets two buses and applies And gate to the 16 corresponding pairs of bits
Or16.hdl - 16-bit Or gate, gets two buses and applies Or gate to the 16 corresponding pairs of bits
Mux16.hdl - 16-bit Multiplexor gate, applies binary Multiplexor logic to 16 bit buses
Or8Way.hdl - 8-bit Or gate, outputs 1 if at least one of the 8 bits is 1, otherwise 0
Mux4Way16.hdl - 4-way Multiplexor gate, gets 4 16-bit buses
Mux8Way16.hdl - 8-way Multiplexor gate, gets 8 16-bit buses
DMux4Way.hdl - 4-way Demultiplexor gate, gets inputs (in, sel[2]) and sets one of 4 outputs to in based on sel
DMux8Way.hdl - 4-way Demultiplexor gate, gets inputs (in, sel[3]) and sets one of 8 outputs to in based on sel
