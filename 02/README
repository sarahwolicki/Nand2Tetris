HalfAdder.hdl - gets two bits and outputs their sum and the carry value
FullAdder.hdl - gets three bits and outputs their sum and the carry value
Add16.hdl - adds two 16-bit binary numbers
Inc16.hdl - increases a 16-bit binary number by 1
ALU.hdl - Arithmetic Logic Unit. gets two 16-bit inputs, and 6 bits that represent the arithmetic action to be applied
ShiftLeft.hdl - gets a 16-bit input and moves every bit one position to the left except the sign bit
ShiftRight.hdl - gets a 16-bit input and moves every bit one position to the right, leaving the sign bit as it is
Mul.hdl - multiplies two 16-bit binary numbers
